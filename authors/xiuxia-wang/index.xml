      <description>Abstract Medium-carbon steels are widely used in structural applications. However, the strength of such steels can hardly be over 1100 MPa. In this work, a cyclic oil quenching process was applied to a common medium-carbon steel, i.e., #45 steel, to produce fine-grains, which exhibited a superior tensile strength of over 1690 MPa with moderate ductility. The microstructural results revealed that the refined grains and imbedded dislocations play a critical role in the strength improvement.</description>
